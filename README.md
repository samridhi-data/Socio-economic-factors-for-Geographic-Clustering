# Socio-economic-factors-for-Geographic-clustering

This project involves analyzing a dataset of various socio-economic attributes for countries worldwide to identify clusters of countries with similar socio-economic factors. The aim is to understand how factors like child mortality, exports, health spending, imports, income, inflation, life expectancy, and fertility rate correlate with GDP across different groups of countries. This analysis will provide insights into the diverse socio-economic landscapes and inform strategies for addressing global economic and social challenges.
